# Chapter 1: Introduction to Angular

## 📘 What is a JavaScript Framework?

A **JavaScript framework** is a collection of pre-written JavaScript code that provides a structure to build web applications efficiently.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- Provides a foundation for building web apps.
- Handles common tasks like DOM manipulation, routing, HTTP requests.
- Encourages best practices and reusable code.

### 🔹 Examples of Popular JS Frameworks:
- Angular
- React
- Vue.js
- Svelte

## 🅰️ What is Angular?

**Angular** is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework developed and maintained by **Google**.

### 🔸 Key Points:
- Fully-featured MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.
- Used for building **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.
- Uses TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) for better tooling and scalability.
- Component-based architecture.

## 🌐 What are Single Page Applications (SPAs)?

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the page.

### ✅ Benefits of SPAs:
- Faster user experience (no full-page reloads).
- Better performance and interactivity.
- Seamless transitions between views.
- Ideal for mobile-friendly web apps.
